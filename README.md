# TadukooFonts
A collection of open source fonts used by Tadukooverse

The fonts contained in this project are all open source. This allows easier use of them. The collection is gathered here to make it easier for Tadukooverse projects to reference them (rather than having to find them scattered everywhere), and their licenses allow us to redistribute them. These fonts will be downloaded by the [Tadukoo Engine/Launcher](https://tadukooverse.github.io/projects/TadukooEngine.html) for use by it and any programs running on it.
